A nifty little app to create visuals for short audio clips

Why?
----
Maybe you want to share a sick hook you've just written, but don't want to wait until you've finished the track.  Maybe you've got an album to promote.  Maybe you want to tease a new tune that's coming out.

Right now you might post a clip on instagram of your Logic screen - sounds great but looks shit.

Wouldn't it be cool if you could just upload some artwork and have a video spit out?  That's what I'm trying to do.

Roadmap
----
* Front end preview
* Audio trimming
* Add image upload and repositioning / resizing
* Hook up to back end renderer
* Possible dropbox integration
* public gallery and user accounts
